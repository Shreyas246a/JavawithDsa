1. What do you mean by an Array?
An array is a data structure in Java that stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same data type. It is a way to store multiple values in a single variable rather than declaring separate variables for each value.

2. How to create an Array?
int[] arr = new int[5]; // creates an array of size 5
arr[0] = 10;            // assigning values
arr[1] = 20;

3. Can we change the size of an array at runtime?
No, once an array is created in Java, its size is fixed. You cannot resize an array at runtime

4. Can you declare an array without assigning the size of the array?
You can declare an array without specifying its size, but you must specify the size when you instantiate it.

5. What is the default value of an Array?
In Java, when an array is initialized but not assigned any values, each element in the array has a default value based on the data type:

int, short, byte, long: 0
float, double: 0.0
char: '\u0000' (null character)
boolean: false
Object: null

6. What is a 1D array with an example?
A 1D array (one-dimensional array) is a list of elements arranged in a single row. It's a simple array where elements are accessed by a single index.

  int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // 1D array

7. Write a program on a 2D array?
A 2D array (two-dimensional array) is an array of arrays, where each element can be accessed by two indices: one for the row and one for the column.

public class TwoDArrayExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Declare and initialize a 2D array
        int[][] arr = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        };
        
        // Accessing and printing 2D array elements
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < arr[i].length; j++) {
                System.out.print(arr[i][j] + " ");
            }
            System.out.println(); // new line after each row
        }
    }
}
